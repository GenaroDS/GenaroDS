# Hi there ðŸ‘‹,
I'm Genaro Di Stilio a computer science student. As I work towards completing my degree, I've gained experience using various Java frameworks while working on my own personal projects, including Vaadin, Spring Boot, and Spring Data. I'm also proficient in plain/vanilla Java and have worked with SQL and Hibernate.

If you're interested in seeing some of my code, please take a look below! I'm always looking for feedback and ways to improve, so any comments or suggestions are greatly appreciated.
